# ARGUS: A Framework for Staged Static Taint Analysis of GitHub Workflows and Actions
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research paper "ARGUS: A Framework for Staged Static Taint Analysis of GitHub Workflows and Actions". This repository contains the website that provides an overview of the paper, its findings, and the ARGUS system. The paper was accepted at USENIX Security 2023.

# Overview
The paper presents ARGUS, the first static taint analysis system for identifying code injection vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions. The authors conducted a large-scale evaluation on 2,778,483 Workflows referencing 31,725 Actions and discovered critical code injection vulnerabilities in 4,307 Workflows and 80 Actions. The paper demonstrates that command injection vulnerabilities in the GitHub Actions ecosystem are not only pervasive but also require taint analysis to be detected.
